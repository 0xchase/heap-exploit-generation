# Heap Exploit Generation

## Ideas
 - Build by scripting PANDA? To be able to introspect the memory of the entire system
 - Build analyses on top of rr?
 - For fast vulnerability discover: statically identify important branches, fuzz and symbolically execute remaining to maximize code coverage, then concilically execute to build consraints for important branches, then build exploit
